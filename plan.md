I have stopped your process on anayzing the olb file conversion improvement task, because I have found some information that can be helpful for you to further improve the olb file conversion process. Please refer to the following information and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

## Futher improvement on olb file conversion
1. I have packed more information for you to use to improve the olb file conversion process. Please refer to those folders
   1. `example\olb\tclscripts\tclscripts\capDB`
   2. `\example\olb\tcltk\tcltk`
   3. `FT260S-R-generated.olb` (This is what was generated by the current conversion process, you can use it as a reference to see what is missing in the conversion)
   4. `FT260S-R.olb` (This is the OrCAD converted olb file, you can use it as a reference to see what is missing in the conversion)
2. Maybe we can use tcltk directly to convert olb files to our library formatm, but this is a windows binary, you will have to help me to get it working on linux, and then we can run it in a docker container to do the conversion.
