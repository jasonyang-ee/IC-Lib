For the xml to olb convertion, I have gathered more information to help with the implementation. Please refer to the `example/olb` directory for sample OLB files generated from the provided XML files using OrCAD, in the process, it seems to have used tcl scripts to do the conversion, so I have also included "output" of tcl file from OrCAD, then there is a reference to the actual script setting saved as .xsd file, which I have also included in the `example/olb` directory. The .xsd file contains the structure and rules for the OLB file format, which should be helpful in understanding how to generate valid OLB files from the XML data. There is also a .log file that shows the process of the convertion, which may provide insights into any potential issues or errors that could arise during the conversion process.

Please refine your implementation plan based on this new information, and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Please also include new feature to auto parse .xml file if user is uploading those directly without .zip file. Those .xml file should auto converted to .olb file and stored in the library, and the original .xml file should be deleted after conversion.

If you may, please do a test run of the conversion process using the provided XML files and the OrCAD software to ensure that the generated OLB files are valid and can be imported back into OrCAD without issues. This will help identify any potential issues in the conversion process and allow for adjustments to be made before implementing the feature in the application. I will handle the testing of the converted olb file with OrCAD, but please make sure to follow the structure and rules defined in the .xsd file to ensure compatibility with OrCAD.
