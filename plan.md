THe agent seems to have stopped for before the plan is fully executed. Please continue with the implementation as planned.

## Additional Notes
1. For ECO, I wish the feature is to be able to assign multiple approvers to each stage, and require a configurable number of approvals before advancing to the next stage. For example, Stage 1 requires 2 approvals from approvers A, B, C, D. Once any 2 of them approve, it moves to Stage 2 which requires 3 approvals from approvers E, F, G, H. This allows for more flexible workflows where you can have multiple approvers at each stage and only require a subset of them to approve.
2. For the audit log, I want to make sure we are tracking all relevant events across components, inventory, projects, ECOs, and user actions. Each log entry should include the user_id (if applicable), activity type, timestamp (which can be extracted from the UUIDv7 ID), and a JSONB details field that can store any relevant information about the event (e.g. what fields were changed in a component update). This will allow us to have a comprehensive history of all actions taken in the system for accountability and debugging purposes.
3. User table in schema should also be using UUIDv7 for the primary key, and we should ensure that all references to users in other tables (e.g. activity_log) use the UUIDv7 user_id.
4. I plan to wipe the entire database and start fresh with the new schema design that uses UUIDv7 for all primary keys, including users. This will allow us to have consistent timestamped IDs across all tables and make it easier to track the creation time of records without needing separate created_at fields.
5. For the frontend, I want to make sure we are using the created_at(id) function to display timestamps for components, inventory entries, projects, ECOs, and activity log entries. This way we can leverage the timestamp embedded in the UUIDv7 IDs and avoid needing separate created_at fields in the database tables.
6. For the dashboard statistics, we can use the created_at(id) function to calculate metrics like "recently added components" by filtering based on the timestamp extracted from the UUIDv7 IDs. This will allow us to have accurate time-based statistics without needing separate timestamp fields in the database.
7. temp file: `tempclaude-****-cwd`, can you please delete those? They are likely from the AI agent's temporary working directory and should not be included in the project files. Thanks!
8. Are you able to merge the `local-start.sh` and `start.sh` scripts into a single `start.sh` that can handle both local development and production deployment based on environment variables? This would simplify the startup process and reduce confusion about which script to use in different environments. Maybe we can use an environment variable like `NODE_ENV=development` and `NODE_ENV=production` to determine the behavior of the `start.sh` script. And, if there is a `.env` file present, it should always behave as `local-start.sh` regardless of the `NODE_ENV` value, since the presence of a `.env` file indicates a local development environment. This way we can have a single entry point for starting the application that automatically detects the environment based on the presence of the `.env` file and the `NODE_ENV` variable. What do you think?
