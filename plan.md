- I have now realized that .xml file from samcsys must be processed by OrCAD to generate .olb file which contains the actual symbol data. Please use those above links as information to see if you can help use to auto process the .xml files to generate .olb files which we can then parse to extract symbol data. We want to automate this process as much as possible since we have a large number of .xml files from samacsys.
