Please do the following tasks to improve the development workflow and maintain consistency across the project. This is a major refactor and improvement plan and may require multiple session to implement, please make sure to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable phase and provide clear instructions for each phase. Then, start the implementation.

## Project setup and workflow improvements
1. unify the `lint.sh` and `test.sh` scripts into a single `check.sh` script that runs both linting and testing sequentially. This will simplify the workflow and ensure that both checks are performed together.
2. update the `README.md` file to reflect the changes in the scripts, including instructions on how to run the new `check.sh` script for both linting and testing. This will help maintain clear documentation for developers working on the project.
3. ensure that the `check.sh` script exits with a non-zero status if either the linting or testing fails, to provide clear feedback on the success or failure of the checks.
4. review github action workflow files to ensure that they are updated to use the new `check.sh` script instead of the separate `lint.sh` and `test.sh` scripts. This will maintain consistency across the development workflow and CI/CD processes.
5. update all three of package.json file scripts to include a new `check` script that runs the `check.sh` script, and remove the separate `lint` and `test` scripts to avoid confusion. This will streamline the command structure for developers and maintain consistency in how checks are run across the project.
6. this project is growing into a giant service, please make sure we never create huge single file, please break down the code into smaller, manageable components and modules to improve readability and maintainability. This will help ensure that the codebase remains organized and easy to navigate as the project continues to grow.
7. if the existing file naming is not consistent, please make sure to rename the files to follow a consistent naming convention that reflects their purpose and functionality. This will help improve code readability and make it easier for developers to understand the structure of the project.

## Existing code and database structure review and refactor
1. currently, the alternative parts setup in database schema is converluted, it seems to have slowed down much of development where AI agent often struggle to understand the structure and relationships between tables. I suggest we review the current database schema for alternative parts and refactor it to be more intuitive and easier to work with. This may involve simplifying the relationships between tables, improving naming conventions, and adding clear documentation for the schema. This will help improve development speed and reduce confusion when working with alternative parts in the database.
2. review the existing codebase for any areas where the alternative parts functionality is implemented, and refactor the code to align with the new database schema. This may involve updating queries, modifying data models, and ensuring that the code is consistent with the new structure. This will help improve code readability and maintainability when working with alternative parts in the application.

## Feature improvement
1. The entire ECO process is still very raw, it is only asking for single approval which is not the case for corporation with multiple stakeholders. I suggest we enhance the ECO feature to support a more comprehensive approval workflow that can accommodate multiple approvers and stages. This may involve implementing a multi-stage approval process, allowing for different levels of approval based on the type of change being proposed, and providing clear notifications and tracking for each stage of the approval process. This will help make the ECO feature more robust and suitable for use in larger organizations with complex approval requirements.
2. review the existing ECO implementation and identify areas where the approval workflow can be improved to support multiple approvers and stages. This may involve updating the database schema to accommodate the new workflow, modifying the user interface to allow for multiple approvers and stages, and ensuring that the code is consistent with the new workflow. This will help improve the functionality and usability of the ECO feature in the application.
3. implement the enhanced ECO approval workflow, including the necessary changes to the database schema, user interface, and codebase. This may involve creating new tables or fields in the database to track the approval stages and approvers, updating the user interface to allow for multiple approvers and stages, and modifying the code to handle the new workflow logic. This will help make the ECO feature more robust and suitable for use in larger organizations with complex approval requirements.

## Email system improvements
1. The email template is too raw, please make sure the email templates used for notifications are well-designed and provide clear information to the recipients. This may involve creating visually appealing templates that include relevant details about the change being proposed, the approval status, and any necessary actions that the recipient needs to take. This will help improve the effectiveness of email notifications and ensure that recipients have a clear understanding of the information being communicated.

## File management improvements
1. This database will save the CAD file name in the parts details, and those should really be synced with the actual files in the file system. There is currently a half completed implementation using `/download` folder to store the files, but it is not fully integrated with the database and file management system. I suggest we review the current file management implementation and refactor it to ensure that the CAD file names stored in the database are properly synced with the actual files in the file system. This may involve implementing a more robust file management system that can handle file uploads, storage, and retrieval in a way that is consistent with the database records. This will help improve the organization and accessibility of CAD files in the application.
2. Please rename `/download` folder to `/library` to better reflect its purpose as a file library for CAD files.
3. review the existing codebase for any areas where the file management functionality is implemented, and refactor the code to align with the new file management system. This may involve updating file upload and retrieval logic, modifying data models to ensure proper syncing between the database and file system, and ensuring that the code is consistent with the new file management approach. This will help improve code readability and maintainability when working with CAD files in the application.
4. We will allow user to drag and drop files to upload, please make sure to implement a user-friendly drag-and-drop file upload interface that allows users to easily upload their CAD files. This may involve creating a dedicated area on the user interface where users can drag and drop their files, providing clear instructions on how to use the feature, and ensuring that the uploaded files are properly processed and stored in the file management system. This will help improve the user experience when uploading CAD files and make it easier for users to manage their files within the application. The frontend implementation should be done in a way that is consistent with the overall design of the application and provides a seamless experience for users when uploading their CAD files.
5. We don't track pad files in the database, but those files are also important for the project, please allow user to upload (multiple) of those file as well.
6. The file upload section should be just append below current distributor information section, and the uploaded files should be listed there as well for easy access and management. This will help improve the organization of the file upload feature and make it easier for users to manage their files in relation to the distributor information.
7. We should also allow user to upload zip file that contains multiple files, and the system should be able to extract the zip file and store the individual files in the file management system. This will help improve the efficiency of uploading multiple files at once and make it easier for users to manage their files within the application. The implementation should ensure that the extracted files are properly processed and stored in a way that is consistent with the existing file management system.
8. I have provided example .zip file from all three major CAD file provider in the `example` folder, please make sure to use those files for testing the zip file upload and extraction functionality to ensure that it works correctly with different types of CAD files. This will help ensure that the implementation is robust and can handle a variety of file formats commonly used in the industry. The example files should be used to thoroughly test the upload and extraction process, including edge cases such as large file sizes and nested directories within the zip file. This will help improve the reliability and usability of the file upload feature in the application.

## Audit log improvements
1. The current audit log implementation is very basic and only tracks a limited set of actions. I suggest we enhance the audit log feature to provide more comprehensive tracking of user actions and changes within the application. This may involve implementing a more robust logging system that can capture a wider range of events, including user logins, data modifications, and system errors. Additionally, we can improve the user interface for viewing the audit log, allowing administrators to easily filter and search through the logs to find relevant information. This will help improve the security and accountability of the application by providing a clear record of user actions and changes made within the system.

## Individual component improvements
1. Allow export of all file for each individual component, including CAD files and datasheets, in a single zip file for easy sharing and backup. This will help improve the usability of the application by providing a convenient way for users to access and share all relevant files for a specific component. The implementation should ensure that the exported zip file is well-organized and includes all necessary files in a way that is easy to navigate for the recipient. This feature will enhance the overall user experience and make it easier for users to manage their component files within the application.

## General code quality improvements
1. Please use minimal icons, I don't like icons.
2. Please make sure to use consistent naming conventions for all variables, functions, and components throughout the codebase. This will help improve code readability and maintainability by making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code. Consistent naming conventions can also help reduce confusion and errors when working with the code, as developers will be able to quickly identify the role of each variable, function, or component based on its name. This will contribute to a more organized and efficient codebase as the project continues to grow.
3. Please ensure that all code is well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality

## Overal feature review
1. Since you are now a more powerful agent, please review the code implemented before by a lesser agent to make sure that the features are implemented in a way that is consistent with best practices and the overall design of the application. This may involve reviewing the code for any areas where improvements can be made, such as optimizing performance, improving readability, or enhancing the user experience. By conducting a thorough review of the existing code, you can help ensure that the features are implemented in a way that is robust, maintainable, and aligned with the goals of the project. This will contribute to the overall quality and success of the application as it continues to evolve.
