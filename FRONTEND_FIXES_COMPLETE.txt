## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Database
```bash
cd /f/DevSQL/allegroSQL
# Resistor table should be created and populated
# Check with: psql -h infra.main.local -p 5435 -U sami -d cip -c "SELECT * FROM resistors;"
```

### 2. Test Frontend
```bash
cd /f/DevSQL/allegroSQL
./start_local.sh

# Open http://localhost:5173
# Test the following:
```

**Library Page:**
- ✓ Type in search field (should accept input)
- ✓ Click "Add Component" button (modal should open)
- ✓ Fill form and submit (component should be added)
- ✓ Select category and check subcategory dropdown (should populate)

**Vendor Search:**
- ✓ Type in search field (should accept input)
- ✓ Submit search (should query APIs)

**Settings:**
- ✓ Navigate to Settings from sidebar
- ✓ Toggle dark/light mode (should switch immediately)
- ✓ Refresh page (preference should persist)

**Dark Mode:**
- ✓ Toggle dark mode in Settings
- ✓ Check all pages render correctly in both modes
- ✓ Verify inputs, buttons, and cards have proper contrast

## Design Reference

The color scheme and dark mode implementation follow the MMMF project style:
- Repository: https://github.com/jasonyang-ee/MMMF
- Key characteristics:
  - Clean, modern interface
  - Smooth theme transitions
  - Consistent dark mode colors
  - localStorage persistence
  - CSS class-based theme switching

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Add more resistor data** - Import additional resistors to build library
2. **API Integration** - Configure real Digikey/Mouser API keys in Settings
3. **Subcategory Management** - Add UI to manage category/subcategory relationships
4. **Extended Settings** - Implement the placeholder setting tiles
5. **Backup System** - Add database export/import functionality
6. **User Management** - Add authentication and user preferences

## Notes

- All input fields now properly handle onChange events
- Dark mode works across all pages and components
- Resistor table structure is extensible for other component types
- Settings page designed for easy addition of new configuration options
- Modal component can be reused for other forms
